# Spam-Call-Detection
In this project, we have developed an Automatic Speech Recognizer(ASR), which detects the speech as Spam or Not Spam. The text generated from the ASR system is run over a python that detects the speech as spam or not. The speech is a mix of Hindi and English languages
We have used two approaches:
1. Python based approach Character-wise 
2. Kaldi-toolkit based approach using Phonemes
